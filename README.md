# cpuInfo
Read the Linux CPU information from /proc/cpuinfo and display it using QML. (My first hands-on experience with QT)

Requirements:
1. The data visualization, including UI layout and design is up to me.
2. The solution must run on a standard Linux system, preferably Ubuntu, and should be written using Qt C++ to read the system information and Qt Quick (not QWidget) to display the data
3. Qt version should be at least Qt 5.4.

Used: QT Creator 4.2.1
